      <description>I have been meaning to get this blog SSL protected for a while and since solution like letsencrypt makes it easy I have generated some SSL keys for my domain and configured it in apache.
So far so good, but the thing is my VM at my hosting provider is pretty small and I have been using varnish for quite some time or I would get out of memory quickly some the kernel OOM killer kicking1 it.</description>

      <description>Like a lot of people I have my irssi on a server in a screen. This has
been working great so far but my only concerns are the notifications
on the desktop when something happening.
Over the time I have found some different solution with mitigated
results for me :
Use fanotify script with the libnotify-bin and SSH like mentioned here.
Setup your irssi (or other) as irc proxy bouncer and connect with</description>

      <description>I have finally changed chmouel.com over a new provider. The new
provider is called WebHost and i got a VPS with 50GB of
bandwith and 2GB of storage for 10US$ a month.
My first task was to compile python2.4 on that box which look like
it&amp;rsquo;s based on RH7.3 with heavy customization. Hopefully python really can compile everywhere.
I would like to thanks Vincent Danen for all his free hosting</description>

      <description>On X86_64 VM Emulation works way better with Xen 3.0 than with Vmware. Xen is pretty awesome compared to Vmware for my use. The only thing i have to figure out is how to get rpmstrap get it workin on Debian base system.</description>
