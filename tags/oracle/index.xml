user user1, and i want to import it to another tablespace
called tablesp2 in an another Oracle 9i tablespace with the user</description>

      <description>If you like me when running oracle on x86_64 get that damn :
Error loading native library: libnjni9.so
when launching dbca and you have googled the thousands five hundred useless answer. Just add the path of the libs $ORACLE_HOME/lib and $ORACLE_HOME/lib32 to your /etc/ld.so.conf (or /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle.conf on RH derivative) and rerun ldconfig.
If this is during install just jump to a console after you add this line before it launching dbca and run a ldconfig -v as root.</description>
