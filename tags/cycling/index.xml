      <description>And here is another year finishing and I am looking back how did I do with my fitness.
I have instead did much more cycling finishing a easy sportive in wales of 130km and a pretty hard one in south of france of 160km with a lot of mountains climbed. I made it to 5000Km (for my racing bike not counting my city bike which has around 500km on it) :</description>

      <description>This post is literally to test the embedding track feature from Garmin Connect &amp;hellip;..
This is a easy bike ride, it start from Ealing to to Decathlon in Canada water and stop in Parsons-Green on my way back to watch Liverpool-Arsenal at mates place before coming back home, my pace was kind of slow since I have a broken thumb and I am trying to respect London traffic now and stop at traffic lights ;-)</description>
