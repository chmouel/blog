People realized that it was just complexity as Joel Spolski points out an attempt to make the complex seem accessible to ordinary people.. Really people were annoyed to write all those tags as those &amp;lsquo;&amp;lt;&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;&amp;gt;&amp;rsquo; are hard to reach on a qwerty keyboard.</description></item><item><title>On trying to be pylint compatible</title><link>https://blog.chmouel.com/2013/04/11/trying-to-be-pylint-compatible/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2013 09:35:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmouel.com/2013/04/11/trying-to-be-pylint-compatible/</guid><description>How I feel when I try to address all pylint warning/errors:

With my work on OpenStack I have found myself jumping a lot between git directories and due configured the variable &amp;lsquo;magit-repo-dirs for easy access to most of them easily.

This make things easy to add as a dependence of your project like you can have something like this in your setup.py :
requirements = ['python-cloudfiles']
and it will automatically download it as part of the dependence with easy_install or pip.
cool kids on latest debian/ubuntu can do stuff like this (from python-stdeb package) :
pypi-install python-cloudfiles
which would automatically download the tarball from pypi and install it as a packages (like the way it should be for prod machine!</description></item><item><title>Get latest lyrics of a scrobbled LastFM song</title><link>https://blog.chmouel.com/2010/10/09/get-latest-lyrics-of-a-scrobbled-lastfm-song/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2010 07:56:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmouel.com/2010/10/09/get-latest-lyrics-of-a-scrobbled-lastfm-song/</guid><description>All my music players (Spotify, XBMC, Rythmbox etc&amp;hellip;) are scrobbling over lastfm but not all of them display song lyrics properly so I came up with a quick Google AppEngine app that grab the latest or current song scrobbled over last.fm and display its lyrics.

I never did any Java before and while I have found Eclipse+Java development surprisingly pleasant and easy to use/learn my favourite are still Emacs+Python.
I have then started to look over Jython to see if I can interact easily with Java via Python and this was actually pretty easy, it took me less than 10mn to convert a Login/Listing-VAPPS script in Jython.</description></item><item><title>Accessing to Rackspace Cloud Files via servicenet (update)</title><link>https://blog.chmouel.com/2009/10/20/accessing-to-rackspace-cloud-files-via-servicenet-update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2009 18:47:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmouel.com/2009/10/20/accessing-to-rackspace-cloud-files-via-servicenet-update/</guid><description>Last week I have posted an article explaining how to connect to Rackspace Cloud Files via Rackspace ServiceNET but I actually got it wrong as pointed by my great colleague exlt so I had to take it down until figured out how to fix it.
