When Montystarted to mentionon the OpenStack development mailing list about a tool he was hacking on allowing to integrate docker containers to do the testing it was obvious it was those ideas that everybody was thinking about that it would be awesome if it was implemented and started to get used.
The idea of dox is like the name imply is to slightly behave like the toxtool but instead of running virtualenvs you are using docker containers.</description></item><item><title>On trying to be pylint compatible</title><link>https://blog.chmouel.com/2013/04/11/trying-to-be-pylint-compatible/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2013 09:35:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmouel.com/2013/04/11/trying-to-be-pylint-compatible/</guid><description>How I feel when I try to address all pylint warning/errors:

When using emacs I wanted a simple way to launch a nosetests on the current function my cursor is in Emacs. The syntax on nosetests is a bit tricky and I actually always have to look at my shell history to know the proper syntax (nosetests directory/filename.</description></item><item><title>Debugging python-novaclient on the command line.</title><link>https://blog.chmouel.com/2011/09/02/debugging-python-novaclient-on-the-command-line/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2011 03:00:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmouel.com/2011/09/02/debugging-python-novaclient-on-the-command-line/</guid><description>I have done lately quite a bit of work with python-novaclientthe (nova/keystone) openstack client.

There is a nice debugging facility in novaclient which you can see while using &amp;ndash;debug argument on the command line and if you wanted to use it with ipython you could have that at the beginning of your session :
This would give you the details of the session showing you the REST requests and responses including the headers.</description></item><item><title>Installing python-cloudfiles from pypi</title><link>https://blog.chmouel.com/2011/02/16/installing-python-cloudfiles-from-pypi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2011 05:41:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmouel.com/2011/02/16/installing-python-cloudfiles-from-pypi/</guid><description>I have just uploaded python-cloudfiles to pypi available here
This make things easy to add as a dependence of your project like you can have something like this in your setup.py :
requirements = ['python-cloudfiles']
and it will automatically download it as part of the dependence with easy_install or pip.
cool kids on latest debian/ubuntu can do stuff like this (from python-stdeb package) :
pypi-install python-cloudfiles
which would automatically download the tarball from pypi and install it as a packages (like the way it should be for prod machine!</description></item><item><title>Python decorator to argument checking</title><link>https://blog.chmouel.com/2010/07/29/python-decorator-to-argument-checking/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2010 19:03:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmouel.com/2010/07/29/python-decorator-to-argument-checking/</guid><description>I am sure there is billions or more people who already done that but I needed this quickly for my project and was not feeling googling around :</description></item><item><title>Get Facebook albums with python</title><link>https://blog.chmouel.com/2010/01/09/get-facebook-albums-with-python/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2010 14:42:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmouel.com/2010/01/09/get-facebook-albums-with-python/</guid><description>Since I haven&amp;rsquo;t see much script like this around the web here is a quick script to suck bunch of albums from facebooks (your own) nothing fancy just something to get you started with pyfacebook.</description></item><item><title>Twitter notification of replies by Email</title><link>https://blog.chmouel.com/2010/01/07/twitter-notification-of-replies-by-email/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2010 14:40:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmouel.com/2010/01/07/twitter-notification-of-replies-by-email/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t check very often my twitter to know when someone replies and I find it hard to figure out what&amp;rsquo;s going on when i check a couple of days after even using a client showing only the reply (my client of choice lately is the Emacs twittering mode client)

Use fanotify script with the libnotify-bin and SSH like mentioned here.

[code lang=&amp;ldquo;bash&amp;rdquo;]
echo &amp;ldquo;encryptedpassword&amp;rdquo;|openssl passwd -1 -stdin

If you want to generate in pure python you can do it like that :

def md5crypt(password, salt, magic=&amp;rsquo;$1$&amp;rsquo;):
import md5
m = md5.new()
