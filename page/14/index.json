There is some cool features inside it :Conditional Expressions:This stuff basically allow to do standard C idiom (that we found in every kind of derivative language) likea = condition ? \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; : \u0026ldquo;false\u0026rdquo;the weird part is that Guido Van-Rossum implemented this syntax :x = true_value if condition else false_valuewhich we will have to get use to.

Most of the \u0026ldquo;brethren\u0026rdquo; think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.","url":"https://blog.chmouel.com/posts/the-purpose-of-education/","date_published":"1948-12-12 10:18:00 +0000 UTC"}]}
