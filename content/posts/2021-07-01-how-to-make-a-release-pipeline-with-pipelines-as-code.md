One of the early goals of [Pipelines as Code](https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/) on Tekton was to ensure the projectâ€™s CI could run using itself.

The common use case of validating pull requests was quickly implemented, and you can find more information about it in this walkthrough video:

For slightly more advanced use cases, here is how we created a release pipeline for the project.

The goal is that when we tag a release and push the tags to the GitHub repository, it will:

- Generate the `release.yaml` file for that version, allowing users to automatically run `_kubectl apply -f-_`.
- Upload the `release.yaml` to a `release-${version}` branch.
- Generate the `tkn-pac` binaries for different operating systems.
- Create the GitHub release.

## Repository Configuration

To achieve this, I created a `Repository` Custom Resource (CR) in the `pipelines-as-code-ci` namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: pipelines-as-code
spec:
  url: https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code
```

The key part is the `branch` and `event_type` fields, which specify that all pushed tags should be handled and run in the `pipelines-as-code-ci` namespace.

## PipelineRun Configuration

Next, I created a [release-pipeline.yaml](https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/blob/main/.tekton/release-pipeline.yaml) `PipelineRun` in the `.tekton` directory, adding the necessary annotations:

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[push]"
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: "[refs/tags/*]"
```

This configuration ensures the `PipelineRun` handles all push tag events.

## Tasks

In the tasks, I included the `git-clone` task and a custom version of the `goreleaser` task, located in the repository at `.tekton/task/goreleaser.yaml`.

The annotation for these tasks looks like this:

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/task: "[git-clone, .tekton/tasks/goreleaser.yaml]"
```

[Goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) simplifies many tasks for us. It compiles binaries, creates a GitHub release, and can generate a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) release in the [openshift-pipelines/homebrew-pipelines-as-code](https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/homebrew-pipelines-as-code/) repository. This allows users on macOS or LinuxBrew to easily install it:

```shell
brew install openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/tektoncd-pac
```

## Uploading the Release

Uploading the `release.yaml` is handled by a Python script I wrote:

<https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/blob/main/hack/upload-file-to-github.py>

The script fetches the tag SHA, creates a `release-${tagversion}` branch, and pushes the file into it. This provides a stable branch with all artifacts specific to that version.

## Final Steps

After everything is in place, I edit the GitHub release, update a few fields for a nicer presentation, and set it as a release (by default, Goreleaser creates a prerelease).
