Container syncing :   Different reseller prefix :   Special reseller admin account :   S3 emulation :  One thing missing in the middleware is to allow auth overriding, basically it means that when an another middleware wants to take care of the authentication for some request the auth middleware will just let it go and allow the request to continue.

Historically nova have shipped with a service called nova-objectstore but the service was buggy and had some security issues. Swift combined with keystone’s s3_token and swift3 middleware now can act as a more reliable and secure objectstore for Nova.\nDEVSTACK support Swift if you add the swift service to the ENABLED_SERVICE variable in your localrc.

The only bit that didn’t made for the devstack essex release is to have glance storing images directly in Swift.\nCLI / Client Library Swift CLI and client library (called swift.common.client) has been updated to support auth v2.0 the CLI support now the common OpenStack CLI arguments and environmentto operate against auth server that has 2.0 identity auth.\nWe unfortunately were not in time to add the support for OS_AUTH_TENANT and use the Swift auth v1 syntax where if the user has the form of tenant:user OS_AUTH_TENANT will become tenant and OS_AUTH_USER the user.\nAside of a couple of bit missing we believe Swift should be rock solid to use with your other OpenStack components.
